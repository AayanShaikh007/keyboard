# June 6th, 12:06 PM - First Update Since Project Start
I have been thinking of this project for a while but was delayed due to some setbacks with my hackpad, which means I will need to accelerate work on this project. I began by doing some research of various aspects/qualities of keyboards, and decided which ones I wanted to implement in my final design. 

In my final design, I really want ...
- Hotswappable keys. This will be achieved by using Kalih Hot-swapp switches, which are fortunately compatible with all MX style switches.
- OLED Display for mode display (probably SSD1306)
- Customizable RGB display, for showing custom animations (SSD1331 perhaps)
- 

Some more standard features ...
- RGB lighting. Ideally, I want to have a led strip on the rim of the keyboard with a plastic covering so that they are not within line of sight, and provide a cool backlight. I could also just place a singular strip on the backside of the keyboard.
