# Keyboard
A custom made keyboard, built + designed completely in house! 

## Description
I've always wanted to make a mechanical keyboard, and after owning two proprietary keyboards, I had an idea of what features I wanted to incorporate in my final design. To begin, I love the OLED display in the high end steelseries keyboards, so that was a must-add. One of my keyboards, a Corsair K65, broke after I tried to fix a malfunctioning switch and damaged the board, shorting the traces for a few surrounding keys. It is due to this that I decided to make this keyboard hot-swappable, so that you can easily swap switches (mx and kalih).
